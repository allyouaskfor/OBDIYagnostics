# THIS IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS
I have no idea what I'm doing...

Custom built OBD-II interface for diagnostics.

Parts used are all recycled goods from thrift stores, things I had taken apart previously that didn’t go back together or, random shit I had laying around. I’m cheap so I spent the least amount of money possible.

- Portable DVD player (two sets from Value Village; only used one set.)
- Raspberry Pi 3b (was my media center but decided this was a better use.)
- OBD-II connector from a bluetooth code reader I bought that only works on android. (I’m an iPhone user. Fuck android.
- DC-DC step-down regulator (12v for DVD player to 5v for RPi)
